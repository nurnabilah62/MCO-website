<center><p>So, all the Malaysian's citizen should be at home during the MCO period and<br> obey the order given by the Prime Minister, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. <br>As I should be at home only, I took all the opportunities during MCO period by <br>doing something that gives benefits for me and also to reduce boredom.</p></center>


<p>The first thing that I do during at home is cooking with my mother and my sister. Usually, we will search for new recipe on google <br>and try to cook it. For example, the recipes that we had try are cake, pudding caramel, mee curry, dalgona coffee which is viral during <br>MCO and also varieties of lunch side dish. It is quite interesting because we are successfully trying the new recipe. We also always<br> share the recipe with my other sister who live in Selangor. She will call through video call to ask for new recipe. Besides, if I feel <br>bored, I will watch the television with my family. Sometimes, I will watch English movie and korean drama. For me, I think it is quite <br> good to be with my family during MCO because it can strengthen our family bonds. We can have group activities together by spending <br> leisure times with family which is great because we can play a board game such as scrabble and monopoly. We all know that quality time <br> with our family is crucial in building stronger relationships. Sharing stories and just being together makes a difference in all of your lives <br> and create wonderful memories that last a lifetime. 

<p>If I canâ€™t be with them for hours upon hours, I will try to attempt to make the most of my time when we are together. This includes <br>putting down my phone and stepping away from the computer when we spend the time together. Next, I will help my mother cleaning<br> the house such as sweeping the floor and doing laundry. By doing this as my routine, it can teach me on how to be harworking and<br>responsible person and also to be more alert with my routine task for everyday. Moreover, my sister and I will do indoor exercise as<br> we cannot jogging outside the house because it is dangerous. The exercise that we usually do is push-ups. Usually, we will repeat this <br> exercise for a total of ten rounds in three minutes.</p>

<p> Sometimes if I feel stress, I will listening to the song and sing it. Then, I will play online game through handphone. I feel excited and quite <br> good because I can play the game with my friends eventhough we cannot meet each other. Though the game is only an entertainment,<br> but online game can give some benefits to us. The benefit is to improves attention and concentration which is video games especially action <br> games, I will give full of attention for the entire period of the game. Besides, it can improves social skills which is online gaming enables many <br> players to engage in a particular game simultaneously. So, my friends and I are able to communicate easily without any obstacles and it can <br> strengthen our relationships as a friend. </p>

<p>Other than that, since we cannot go to the class, we need to learn through online distance learning which is an effective method to do a class. <br>Lecturer will use alternative ways to share their knowledge with students and teach us such as using 'Google Classroom' and 'Hangouts Meet'.<br>At first, I feel a little overwhelmed with distance learning because it is quite difficult rather than normal class which is face to face. <br>Sometimes, I always have a slow Internet problems which affects my studies. But if I look in positive ways, there are many advantages in online <br> learning. By online learning, I can have flexible schedule which is I can choose my own learning environment that works best for me and I don't<br> need to commute to class. Besides,  study online requires more self-motivation and time-management skills because it will spend a lot of time on <br>my own and I should be more alert with the deadlines for the assessment and test.</p>
